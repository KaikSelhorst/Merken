      <MediumTitle>What is a Markdown</MediumTitle>
      <p>
        Markdown is a markup language that makes it easy to write content in
        plain text. It was designed to be easy to read and write for everyone,
        including people who aren't programmers. Markdown is popular for writing
        content for the web. It's used by bloggers, programmers, students, and
        anyone else who needs to create HTML or XHTML on the fly.

        It doesn't matter if you're using a computer or mobile deviceâ€”markdown
        will work wherever you are.
