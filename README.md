# Merken

### Description

Merken is a web application for easy editing of markdown-style text. It offers a live preview allowing the user to see what is written and make changes in real time. This tool also offers customization of themas and font families to adapt to your writing style. Merken is ideal for anyone who needs a powerful markdown editor with professional features.

### Prerequisites

To start the project the first step is to download and install `Node.js`, which is a JavaScript development platform that makes it possible to run JavaScript code outside the browser. Also, if you are using Vscode, you need to download the `TypeScript Vue Plugin extension (volar)`. Both are minimum requirements to start the project.

```bash
$ npm install    # Install all dependencies

# Exist 3 options for  project startup

$ npm run dev    # Developement mode
$ npm run build  # Production mode
$ npm run lint   # Use diferent lint config
```
